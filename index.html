    <p class="p1">For our final project, my team of four built a 2D game using Unity and C# in just one week. We chose to do this because as a team we all wanted to test our skills and see if we can wrangle a new language under the safety that dev academy gave us. We also are all avid gamers and just wanted to try our hand at creating something that we ourselves have spent a long time playing and to see what it actually takes to create a video game. As the team lead and level designer, I was responsible for designing the levels and overseeing the project's progress. While the rest of the team focused on scripting I collaborated with them to ensure that the game's level was engaging and challenging. It was a great experience leading the team and contributing to the success of the project, I also belive that that success caame from us as a group because we added lots of things we learnt at dev like stand-ups and a non technical stand-up we dubbed a huddle. This gave us all the oppertunity to say how we were feeling in an open and safe space. I beleive there is tallks of us getting together again and trying our hand at making a proper title also so watch this space! </p>
