   <h1 class="eq">JavaScript + DOM</h1>
    <h2>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h2>
    <p class="p1">I think a car is a good anology for this. i think of the chassis of a car like html, its the framework that holds everything together. the paint job and interior is the css with all its cool finishing touches and the motor is JavaScript which is what powers the car and gets all these things working in unison. </p>

    <h2 class="h2">Control flow and Loops</h2>
    <p class="p1">Control flow is the syntax in which your computer will read and execute your code. It helps to think of it like a step by step guide for your pc to follow and sometimes we have to meet certain conditions in order to progress through the guide. These are called loops, they kind of side track us off our main guide and repeat a line of code and wont continue until a certain condition is met. An example of this could be making your morning coffee. You follow the same steps everyday like:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Put jug on</li>
      <li>Get mug and coffee</li>
      <li>Put 1 spoon of coffee in mug</li>
      <li>Pour hot water in mug</li>
      <li>Drink</li>
    </ol>
   <p class="p1">This would be your control flow but if i wanted to change that and stir after i poured hot water in mug id have a loop that would outline the conditions of how many times i have to stir before i can drink</p>

   <h2 class="h2">The DOM</h2>
   <p class="p1">The DOM is basically a representation of a webpage that is able to manipulate the HTML elements using JavaScript. We can do this by acessing the certain objects on a tree like structure </p>

    <img src="/photos/pic_htmltree.gif" alt="image">

    <p class="p1">How we do this is by either selecting the certain "id", "elements" or "class"by using:</p>
      <ul class="lists">
        <li>document.getElementById("id-name")</li>
        <li>documnet.querySelector("Element-name")</li>
      </ul>
    
      <p class="p1">Then add prooerties like "innerHTML" to modified selected elements like changing the color of the text or ever the text itself. </p>

      <h2 class="h2">Accessing data from Arrays and Objects</h2>
      <p class="p1">Arrays and objects are basically containers to store data in to keep things organized. we can all on the data from inside the arrays or objects and use how we like but there are differences in how to access each container of info.</p>

        <dt class="lists">Arrays</dt>
          <dd>We can access the data from arrays using a index system. The index system actually starts from zero so an example could be const burgerIngredients = [cheese, tamatoe, beef, bacon] and how we would call on a specific ingredient would be like burgerIngredients[2] which would call beef since we start counting from zero </dd>

        <dt class="lists">Objects</dt>
        <dd>Since objects dont store data like indexes when need to use a dot notation or a bracket notation. first it probably helps to see an object displaying its data so heres a customer's receipt:

           const receipt ={
            items: 'beefBurger'
            time: '18:56'
            total: '8:50'
           }
           These are key-value pair, the key being the name of the data point, and the value is the data point itself. Now we can use the dot notation or bracket notation to access the data.</dd>

           <h2 class="h2">Who, What, When, Why, Functions?</h2>
           <p class="p1">Funtions are just peices of code that you can write once and call over and over again to save you time. They have many capibilitys but its really up to you what the can do. Heres an incredibly basic example of a function where if you call shout it will return echo:</p>

           function shout(echo) {
            return 'echo'
          }
          

             <p class="p1">See now once that is made it will always return 'echo' if you call shout. This is a really easy example of what a function does.</p>
