   <h1 class="eq">JavaScript + DOM</h1>
    <h2>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h2>
    <p class="p1">I think a car is a good anology for this. i think of the chassis of a car like html, its the framework that holds everything together. the paint job and interior is the css with all its cool finishing touches and the motor is JavaScript which is what powers the car and gets all these things working in unison. </p>

    <h2 class="h2">Control flow and Loops</h2>
    <p class="p1">Control flow is the syntax in which your computer will read and execute your code. It helps to think of it like a step by step guide for your pc to follow and sometimes we have to meet certain conditions in order to progress through the guide. These are called loops, they kind of side track us off our main guide and repeat a line of code and wont continue until a certain condition is met. An example of this could be making your morning coffee. You follow the same steps everyday like:
      <ol>
      <li>Put jug on</li>
      <li>Get mug and coffee</li>
      <li>Put 1 spoon of coffee in mug</li>
      <li>Pour hot water in mug</li>
      <li>Drink</li>
    </ol>
   This would be your control flow but if i wanted to change that and stir after i poured hot water in mug id have a loop that would outline the conditions of how many times i have to stir before i can drink</p>

   <h2 class="h2">The DOM</h2>
   <p class="p1">The DOM is basically a representation of a webpage that is able to manipulate the HTML elements using JavaScript. We can do this by acessing the certain objects on a tee like structure
