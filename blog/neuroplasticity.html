    <h1 class="eq">Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
    <h2>What is Neuroplasticity?</h2>
      
    <p class="p1">Neuroplasticity is the process in which all permanant learning is taking place in the brain such as learning a language or an instrument. Studies have shown that just by knowing that Neuroplasticity even excists and that intelligence is malleable that people did better in school than those who didnt. I could easily see myself engaging with these princables just to deepen my knowledge on things, i geuss its just good to know that even by imagining something that your brain is basically excersising and devoloping new pathways or strengthing old ones. Ways of devoloping this big word Neuroplasticity is by continuing to practice things or even imagine your practicing it, I reckon puzzles must be pretty good have you tried a soduku? Basically never stop learning or using your brain because your brain is effecient and doesnt want to waste power on old topics so it kinda shrinks the pathways but by using those pathways the become stronger and connect to more things making your brain bigger :) </p>

    <h2>What is Growth Mindset?</h2>
    <p class="p1">I feel like a growth mindset is about understanding that your on a knowledge journey and that although you might not understand something yet you will in the future. Something that really surprised me when reshearching this was the study into schools that follow the growth mindset and ones that dont. What was surprising was how schools that did follow it were miles ahead of the other schools and have gone from the lower percentile to the top percentile when it came to grades. I feel like this will help me on this journy and others is mostly about keeping an open mind and setting goals to get through that arnt rediculous, Im going to include this good infographic in kinda the path youd lead if you follow growth mindset as apposed to a fixed minset.</p>

    <h2>How will i blend these two into my learning?</h2>
    <p class="p1">Well i feel like Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset have influenced the way ill learn from here on out. ive heard of it before but until reshearching it i didnt realise the positive impact it could have and in a relatively short period of time too! I dont think i could learn anything without these tools anymore and have sorta retrofitted my exsisting goals and added more along the way that will aid the seratonin dump that you get when you cross something off a list and just make the learning experiance a more positive one with better outlooks. </p>
