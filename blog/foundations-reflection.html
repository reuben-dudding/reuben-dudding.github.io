    <h2> What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>

    <p class="p1">
      I think the three would be this need for the code to work first go and would get mildly annoyed and when it doesnt work, this is probs cause i wanna engage as hard cause it means im trying and could potential fail and look silly. Another thing would be finding it really hard to communicate and ask for help when needed for whatever reason, maybe im just a bit spooked but what others seem to know idk. Finally i set wildly unacheivable goals which just dont help me whatsoever so i adjusted to creating smaller goals which seemed to work greatly.

    <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
    <p class="p1">
      I would have to say that they are every bit as important as being able to perform technically. Values and empathy shape who we are as a person and how you treat others, relate to and work within a team and even yourself! Self awareness is about being present of how the way your acting is affecting the enviroment your in and the people around you its also about taking a step back from simply reacting and  question the presence of the ego and how it affects you.

    <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
    <p class="p1">
      What surprised me the most about learning core is how much your brain, ability and learning capacity can change and grow throughout active practice. The process of neuroplasticity blew my mind (literally) i just thought how cool is this along with a growth mindset is just a killer team.

    <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
    <p class="p1">
      I think the hardest part of the core was the level of intraspection going on, i found it difficult to begin with to write anything of actual substance before coming to terms that its actually quite cathartic writing it all out. I found introducing myself to be quite difficult it was weird it ws like i didnt know what to write it just wasnt the best of times.

    <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
    <p class="p1">
      I think because you guys understand that we are all human and we need to be able to understand, communicate and work with one another. This will help us in any venture we take after this course and these core skills are pivotal in stressful work enviroments that we may encounter along our journey. I feel like you guys understood the difficulty of learning 3 languages in 6 weeks and through core skills you taught us ways to cope with that which once again will go with us wherever we go.

    <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.<h2>
    <p class="p1">
      No not at all! i quite enjoyed learning about core and if im being honest, The break between coding is nice. I think im probably going to use the core skills just as much as the tech skills so i found it quite good learning all about it, i feel like it has improved me as a person so thats good.
