      </div>
      <h2> What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
    <p class="p1">I feel as if emotional intelligence is about recognizing your own emotions and how they can often effect the people around you. Its about having empathy for others and recognizing a cry for help in between the lines. EQ is vital to maintaining relationships, working well with others and navigating conflicts youd find going through life.</p>

    <h2 class="h2">How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
    <p class="p1">EQ is the measurement on someones emotional comptetency and how one can identify and control their own emotions. It's also about being able to evaluate how others are feeling, and to be able to connect with people and relating to them. IQ is more of a measure on someones cognitive abilities like knowledge, reasoning and processing. It sort of helps to think of EQ being street smart and IQ being book smart. </p>

    <h2 class="h2">Why is EQ important?</h2>
    <p class="p1">I feel like EQ is important because it helps you navigate the things that matter the most in life like the relationships with the people around you. It also helps releive your own interpesonal stress and conflicts in turn building you into a more confident and refined individual. Emotional intelligence can lead to greater self awareness which in turn makes the world better for everyone</p>
