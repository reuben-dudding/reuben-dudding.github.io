    <h2 class="h2">Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h2 class="h2">
    <p class="p1">Basically i was driving home one day and watched someone drive off the side of the bank through the barriers and everything, it was the wildst thing to watch unfold and took me forever to react to it but anyway my decision (againts my rational part of my brain) here was to help this person out so i find the car a find out im pretty much the only person doing anything so i made the dicison to call 111 and got that into motion whilst trying to see if this person is ok. everything turned out ok in the end but honestly i just wanted to drive straight past and go home after a long day of work but something wouldnt let me. i think it was the bystanders just watching me that pissed me off so i knew i had to help. what i still ask myself was did i do it for my own moral code and not to help them or the other way around</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>
    <p class="p1">in the beginning pretty poorly if you ask me, all your views on the world are diluted when your young that when you get older things start to come clearer (or muddier depending on how you view things). i feel like the culture surrounding me during my youth sheilded me alot from the outside world so the first few years of adulthood were a biit of a shock. Through new connections and getting out of my comfort zone do i have found more of myself and what i stand for, certain situations arise through life where youve got to look inward on what your doing and ask if this is where you wanna be, many if the encounters have and will continue to shape me in a way that atleast my mum would be proud</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>
    <p class="p1">i think a good strength of mine is determination and willpower, i feel like this will help me on this journey by getting the most out of it. i also left quite a good job to persue this change so im filled with a sense of duty not to waste it, i want to succed, i'am going to succed </p>
    <h2 class="h2">Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h4>
    <p class="p1">i think the biggest limitation for me would be my own thoughts, them telling me i cant do it etc.. i feel like this will impact on my drive and put me down making me feel like i cant do it so i might aswell give up now you kno? Another limitation of mine would be asperations, yes i want to work on cars but theres more to life than that. i feel like i would stagnate in a carreer path due to not really seeing the value in trying to calw my way to the top but this could also prevent me from oppertunities that might present themselves if i had just tried a little harder. </p>
    <h2 class="h2">Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h5>
    <p class="p1">Back when i was a builder working on sites theres this sort of hierarchy at play and if your on the bottom it isnt the greatest. I was middle of the hierarchy and had people 20yrs my senior working under me which can be awkward to say the least. This sometimes was difficult to manage due to egos and bullshit male brevado. Usually id like to break tension with good convo and including them in what im doing, teaching them what i know and why we do things. i feel like this works the best, everyone wants to be included its only natural so i try to atleast eleviate that worry by trying hard o make suure you are.</p>
