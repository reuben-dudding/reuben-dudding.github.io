    <h1 class="eq">Problem Solving</h1>
    <h2>That time i was stuck (which time?)</h2>
    <p class="p1">
      A good challenge i faced last week was doing the JS Kata: Capitalize excersise, I basically had to map over an array and return a string that had capital letters on every word. I struggled with putting everything together at the end of the function. I think what helped me figure it out was talking it over with my partner which really helped, i also reached out on discord for a hand but only once i kinda figured out what needed to happen but just didnt know how to impliment it. They pointed me in the right direction and then the problem was solved. I felt pretty optimistic and determined at most points along the way with the obvious bouts of frustration in between especially when i figured out how close i was to solving it on my own. What i took away from it is that you can use a method at the end of a funtion by its lonesome to finish it off like this :

    <h2>That one time I solved a problem</h2>
    <p class="p1">
      So the time I elegantly solved a problem last week would probably be the manipulating objects in the JS Kata tests. The problem had me creating and well... manipulating objects like chnaging the age of someone, adding there children or spouse and linking childen between them. I used a lot of google and console.log to help me navigate through it. I felt pretty good about this throughout because i think i just had quite a decent understanding of objects to begin with so building upon that wasnt too difficult. I think it was the first time I used dot notation to assign things to objects so that was cool and helped me alot when it came back in the gradebook test aswell. I Thought this was a good example because it was a challenge but i just researched well an it all came together relatively painlessly.

    <h2>Reflection time</h2>
    <p>
      <dl>
       <dt>1. Pseudocode</dt>
      <dd>
        I tried it quite a bit, especially with the start of each challenge usually by the end tho its gone haha. it helps me see the end goal so ill keep doing it in the future 5/10 
      </dd>
      <dt>2. Trying Something</dt>
      <dd>
        I do this alot, i think it helps me get silly ideas out of my head lol 7/10
      </dd>
      <dt>3. Rubber Ducky Method</dt>
      <dd>
        I tried this a few times and it was good, i find that it helps when all else fails. i kind of do it internally or sometimes talk to a flatmate about it. 4.5/10
       </dd>
       <dt>4. Reading Error Messages</dt>
       <dd>
        I do this often, it helps narrow down the problem so you can focus on it then google if you cant understand what its saying. this is probably my prefered method 8/10
       </dd>
       <dt>5. Console.log</dt>
       <dd>
        I do this when i get really stuck and im trying to split the function into understandable pieces. i need to impliment a bit more i think because it does help when your splitting and mapping thing to be able to keep track of them.
       </dd>
       <dt>6. Elgoog</dt>
       <dd>Oh Google, honestly the best tool we have at our disposal. Not a day goes buy without 50 tabs of google being open on chrome goes by. The only downfall of google is your understanding of what it is your searching so i try to atleast narrow down exactly what i need. 7/10 because i need to understand more to get more use. bad data in, bad data out. 
       </dd>
       <dt>7. Asking Peers</dt>
       <dd>
        I desperatly need to do this more i know you guys wont bite but its daunting you kno? on the odd time that i have asked for help its been fantastic and have gone away with a better understanding so yeah gotta do it more. Im not scared i just dont want to waste your time.  2/10
       </dd>
       <dt>8. Asking Coaches</dt>
       <dd>
       I feel like im a bit better with the coaches that my peers, not sure why that is to be fair but they are great im not scared saying whats going on or whatnot. i think im just a bit too proud to come and ask for help sooner. 5/10
       </dd>
       <dt>9. Improving Through Reflection</dt>
       <dd>
        I Enjoy they fact that im learning so im always kinda taking away what worked best for me and doing that  alot. I like to reflect on what gave me the most trouble and why, i remember a problem i had involving loops and i kinda realised i knew too little about them to get through so i had to get better at that to proceed. Ive now learnt that maybe i have to strip it down to the basics first then complicate it. 7/10
