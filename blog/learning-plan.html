    <dt>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</dt>
    <dd>I think id really like to do something in the automotive industy, i would like to be designing the user interface and but where i really would like to be is in the tuning game but honestly i just wanna work around cars</dd>
    <dt>2. description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</dt>
    <dd>A stregnth of mine would be how i find the answer i need to a problem quite swiftly and how im actually really enjoying learning alll this new stuff! A weakness would probably direction, I struggle with what it is im trying to focus on and keep going off on tangents or wasting time researching buttons lol</dd>
    <dt>3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</dt>
    <dd>I would like to be more open when needing help, usually i just hide and try and figure it out myself, I think this will help me out more in the long run. Id also want to work on how to manage stress in a more healthier way as apposed to the self destructive ways im used to.
    <dt>4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</dt>
    <dd>Basically i will take the content and chop it into smaller blocks ive spaced out over the week. ill then stick to these time slots and try get the alotted work done. hopefully this helps the feeling of dread when you open a new sprint and look at the material. also i need to be better with my breaks, needs better structure so ill probably adopt a similar pattern to my last job</dd>
     From what ive seen from the facilitators so far has been great, id like to see myself using them a bit more or discord channels atleast for help. I would love to see  honest and constructive feedback to help me peform better in the future. 
     I basically dropped all commitments for this bar my friends haha, i want to succed in this course so ive kind of put my life on pause for a bit while im doing this and i really like it that way, it helps me focus</dd>
