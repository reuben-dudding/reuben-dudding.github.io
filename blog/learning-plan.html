    <h1 class="eq"> Goals for my learning, Learning goals if you will</h1>
     
   <p><dl>
    <dt>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</dt>
    <dd>I think id really like to do something in the automotive industy, i would like to be designing the user interface and but where i really would like to be is in the tuning game but honestly i just wanna work around cars</dd>
    <dt>2. description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</dt>
    <dd>A stregnth of mine would be how i find the answer i need to a problem quite swiftly and how im actually really enjoying learning alll this new stuff! A weakness would probably direction, I struggle with what it is im trying to focus on and keep going off on tangents or wasting time researching buttons lol</dd>
    <dt>3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</dt>
    <dd>I would like to be more open when needing help, usually i just hide and try and figure it out myself, I think this will help me out more in the long run. Id also want to work on how to manage stress in a more healthier way as apposed to the self destructive ways im used to.
    <dt>4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</dt>
    <dd>Basically i will take the content and chop it into smaller blocks ive spaced out over the week. ill then stick to these time slots and try get the alotted work done. hopefully this helps the feeling of dread when you open a new sprint and look at the material. also i need to be better with my breaks, needs better structure so ill probably adopt a similar pattern to my last job</dd>
     From what ive seen from the facilitators so far has been great, id like to see myself using them a bit more or discord channels atleast for help. I would love to see  honest and constructive feedback to help me peform better in the future. 
     I basically dropped all commitments for this bar my friends haha, i want to succed in this course so ive kind of put my life on pause for a bit while im doing this and i really like it that way, it helps me focus</dd>

        <dt>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</dt>

      
          <dd>
            At the moment im enjoying most aspects of this so its difficult to see what i want to do afterwards i think a long time goal of mine would to be proficient in all 3 languages (css, html, JS) and also get into python so i can do more with programming, preferably on the engineering side of things. It i just hope it has code in it somewhere, right now i just wanna keep practicing my code.
          </dd>
        <dt>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</dt>


         <dd>
          I feel like a strength of mine would be relating to people and making friends stuff like that, I also realy wanna do well in this course aswell. a limitation would be my code knowledge atleast at the moment that is, im actively working on it :) I still agree with the finding the learning fun. The weakness from sprint 2 has improved, ive learnt that i just need to slow down a chop the questions up into smaller bits to go through it peice by peice. ive learnt better communication skills so that going to help in bootcamp which is a plus.
         </dd>
        
        <dt>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</dt>


         <dd>
          probably asking for help, i feel like im wasting their time but i know im not. i feel like ill be better in person though so i hope thats true. I struggle speaking in front of people so im not looking forward to that at all lol, i also shy away from leadership roles cause i dont want the responsibility.
         </dd>
        <dt>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</dt>


         <dd>
          I wanna see myself have clearer communication with other people i also wanna see myself continue doing mindfulness everyday caause i find that it helps a bit. I would like to see how i work in groups i hope my people skills are up for it and if not i hope to improve them.
         </dd>
        <dt> What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</dt>


         <dd>
          I just want to atleast to be heard when i voice concerns about things and be supported when i feel like im falling behind or having trouble getting somewhere. i dont know what else to add they have been great so far
         </dd>
        <dt>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</dt>


         <dd>
          To be disciplined and focused on the course and the content. I want to make the most out of this opportunity and I donâ€™t want to look back and think that I did let myself down. Ill ask for help after from fellow peers if stuck for longer than 15 mins. I i dont want to feel like im not good enough to be there and also to look after my mental and physical health. I dont have on myself and to try and enjoy myself.
